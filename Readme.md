# OffHook

This is a small programm that uses the Jabra SDK for emulating a softphone.

It is useful if you have a non-Jabra aware communication client (e.g. **GoToMeeting**) and you want to control the off-hook functionality of your headset.
If you do not set the headset to off-hook state, an incomming call will capture the headset and your computer audio communication is interrupted.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the [Jabra SDK](https://developer.jabra.com/site/global/sdks/windows/index.gsp).
